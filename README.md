# WaterPlotR
#
# This is a function that takes a directory (as a string) with bedgraphs and plots them all on waterfall plots.
# Each line is normalized to itself, rather than the group. All bedgraph files are assumed to have a header.
# The output is a single .png file.
#
# Dependencies: ggplot2, dplyr
